# System adequacy case study for CVAE load generation, PSCC 2022

This code accompanies the multi-area system adequancy case study of the paper *Generating Multivariate Load States Using a Conditional Variational Autoencoder* by
Chenguang Wang, Ensieh Sharifnia, Zhi Gao, Simon H. Tindemans, Peter Palensky, accepted for publication at PSCC 2022 and a special issue of EPSR.

A preprint is available at: https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.11435. If you use (parts of) this code, please cite the preprint or published paper.
